		Instructions - Non-Invasive Core Body Temperature Tool

1. Place the axilla thermometer as far as possible in the crook of the patients 
arm pit area. 

2. Place the mask on the patient using strap, and ensure that there is a tight fit. 

3. Turn on the device and make sure that the BMP180 temperature module is not in 
contact with anything to ensure accurate environmental data. 

4. Monitor the live graph and wait for the mask temperature and axilla temperature
to stabilize. 

5. Go to the data tab and observe the estimated core body temperature measurement. 
The measurement should be quite stable at this point. Temperature sensors must be 
in place for about 1-2 minutes to obtain a stabilized result. 

6. Take appropriate measures to care for the patient depending on the estimated 
core body temperature reading.
